# MCP Rules Engine Status Report

## Overview
The MCP Rules Engine server is successfully running and properly configured. The server provides regex-based text redaction capabilities for sensitive information through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Server Status
- **Server Status**: ✅ Running on `http://localhost:6366`
- **Redaction Functionality**: ✅ Working correctly
- **MCP Integration**: ✅ Configured correctly with HTTP transport

## Redaction Rules Working
The Rules Engine successfully redacts the following types of sensitive information:
- ✅ SSNs (e.g., 123-45-6789 → \<SSN>)
- ✅ Credit Cards (e.g., 4111-1111-1111-1111 → \<CREDIT_CARD>)
- ✅ Email Addresses (e.g., test@example.com → \<EMAIL>)
- ✅ Phone Numbers (e.g., 555-123-4567 → \<PHONE>)
- ✅ API Keys/Credentials (e.g., api_key=abcd1234 → \<CREDENTIAL>)

## API Endpoints
The server exposes the following endpoints:
- `/health` - Check server health
- `/mcp-tools` - List available MCP tools
- `/redact_text` - Direct endpoint for text redaction
- `/process_text` - Advanced text processing with rule sets
- `/mcp` - MCP JSON-RPC endpoint

## Claude CLI Integration
The Claude CLI is configured with the SSE transport for this MCP server:
```
claude mcp add rules_engine "http://localhost:6366/sse" --transport sse --scope local
```

## Recent Configuration Updates
The configuration was updated to fix connection issues:
1. Using SSE transport which is required for Claude CLI
2. Modified protocol version to use the "execute" method instead of "tools/call"
3. Increased timeout to 60 seconds to allow proper processing time
4. Updated server to use rules_engine_mcp_sse.py for consistent behavior

## Management Scripts
The following scripts can be used to manage the MCP server:
- `run_mcp_server.sh` - Start the MCP server
- `stop_mcp_server.sh` - Stop the MCP server
- `start-claude-with-mcp.sh` - Start Claude with MCP integration

## Testing
A comprehensive test script is available at `test_mcp.py` that verifies:
- Direct API redaction through `/redact_text`
- JSON-RPC redaction through `/mcp` with method `execute`

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with the MCP server:

1. Check if the server is running:
   ```bash
   curl -s http://localhost:6366/health
   ```

2. Test the redaction endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text":"Test with SSN 123-45-6789"}' http://localhost:6366/redact_text
   ```

3. Test the MCP protocol directly:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"execute","params":{"name":"redact_text","parameters":{"text":"Test with SSN 123-45-6789"}}}' http://localhost:6366/mcp
   ```

4. Restart the MCP server:
   ```bash
   ./stop_mcp_server.sh && ./run_mcp_server.sh
   ```

## Next Steps
- Consider adding additional redaction patterns if needed
- Monitor server logs for any errors or issues
- Ensure the server starts automatically with the system when needed
